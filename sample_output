Hello and welcome to the L-test.
We use the Prime Counting function as a reference data set.
You have 34 data points.
The graph is that many numbers, and the count of how many primes they cover each.
Even and odd number counts are not quite the same but they go up in a messy way like hospital data.

Probability that even and odd Prime Counts from 34 are samples from same population:
0.8093453444914191

Information derived from that probability:
0.3051726685308276

Note the p value is more than 0.5 because the are in reality chosen from the same set.
Note the information is low because they are not surpising in terms of each other.
Your null data has the following L-test score:  22.993

To get the same false difference between odd and even we need   19      false counts of 1 integer.
Spoiling evens with these gives a spoiled p of:         0.004668162853886273
Which is an absolute increase in disinformation of:     7.437756724238557
And a prime count disinformation ratio of:              24.37228982544752
